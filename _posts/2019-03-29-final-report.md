# Things I did This week

This week I improved the design and prototypes of the travel website. Particularly, I made change in the footer of the design.
Also, I made the tutorial for my website which can help a person who is new to Adobe XD.


# Evaluation

 I decided that I would design a travel website and explore the tools of Adobe XD. I completed my  project on time and the scope was met.
I used various tools of Adobe XD such as repeated grid , symbols, scrolling, overlay transition, auto-animated transition. I followed some tutorials to learn these tools.

# Lessons Learned

* I learned how to use a new designing and prototyping tool Adobe XD. 
* I learned how to create design of a website and how to create prototypes for those designs. 
* I learned how to prepare a tutorial about a software which is new to a person.

# Unexpected Challenges

Although I did not face any major problem because I was familiar with Adobe Illustrator and had knowledge about its basic tools yet, I faced some difficulty in repeat grid and overlay at first. But I followed some tutorials and they helped me a lot in clearing my doubts.


# Future Work
I can use Adobe XD for designing and prototyping any website. Also, I found Adobe XD to be much more efficient than other softwares I have used till now.
