# [ Final Report ]({% post_url 2019-02-01-final-report %})

# Things I did This week 
- Create the background design on illustrator
- Worked on animation where patients goes out from the hospital after 5 days period
- Give the final touch to keyframes

# Evaluation
- I was able to complete my character animation within 4 week during this I had faced difficulties like how to set the keyframes for their proper movement and difficulty in using pupet tool in the starting of the project.           

# Lessons Learned
- Good understanding of using adobe after effects, adobe illustartor
- Knowledge about 2D animations

# Unexpected Challenges
- Character legs were not moving at first than I learned about loops which helped create leg movements
- Importing layers from illustartor also created some problems which required arrangement

# Future Work
- Refining the character animation
- Learning advanced 3D animations
- Using the created animation in our project 2 website which is also related to health
