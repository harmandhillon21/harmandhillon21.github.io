# [Week - 4 Project-B]({% post_url 2019-03-15-week4 %})

## This Week 
  *  This Week i finalize the typography and prototype design. I did the homepage design 
   and contact page design.
   * I have designed the logo for the prototype.
   * While using some tools like repeat grid and overlay tranistion i had faced some diffculites. But with usage i think i will 
   be able to overcome those.Major problem was when i use the mask tool in grid system it applies on all the grid rather than the portion i want it to be applied on.


## Next Week

* I will design other page such as Booking Page, Package list and more.
* I will explore more about abode xd tools.
